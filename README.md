## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

With this challenge I learned how to put background color on top of an image and to adjust more accurately the mobile screen when the display changes. For example in desktop view the text is on the horizontal and on mobile is on column (or vertical). 

### Continued development

I will still do all the challenges from Frontend Mentor and practice more with responsive design!

### Useful resources

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9182978/semi-transparent-color-layer-over-background-image) - I used this to understand how to properly put the color on top of an image.
